>A simple shorthand for including proc-macro source files in the module tree for external tooling like IDEs or other similar purposes.



## Usage

The `include_proc_macro` crate provides a macro designed for easy integration with external tooling, particularly 
when working with procedural macros. It's extremely simple, just wraps an `include!` macro call with some sugar, and is 
primarily useful to reduce 
boilerplate 
and prettify 
proc-macro code.

The macro checks if debug assertions are enabled (`#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`). If debug assertions are enabled, it 
includes a targeted .rs file from the Cargo project's root directory (obtained through the `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` 
environment variable) in the module tree. Simple as that.

## Example

In Rust:
```rust
// lib.rs
include_proc_macro::include_proc_macro!("sample");
```

The above command includes `sample.rs` from the root of the Cargo project during a debug assertion (development time). It simply expands to:

```rust
#[cfg(debug_assertions)]
include!(
    concat!(
        env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"),
        "/",
        "sample", // <-- arg
        ".rs"
    )
);
```

The main parameter of the macro is:

- `$file_name`: a string literal representing the name of the procedural macro source file (.rs) to be included in 
  the module tree during development time (this situationally helps enabling certain advanced IDE features).

### In practice

You'll want to use the macro in a location that your development tools recognize as part of the module tree. In many 
cases, this means using it in the `lib.rs` file of the procedural macro crate.

> Note:
> Please remember that you should *not* use or depend on the procedural macro code being exposed beyond the confines 
> of its crate. This configuration is designed to function in the reverse direction: it introduces features like 
> auto-completion into the procedural macro crate during development. *That's the reason why we only include them during debug assertions.*



## The problem

For some IDEs or other kinds of programming environments, understanding the module tree is crucial as it improves 
the developer experience by providing features like auto-completion and stable syncing. This is situational, and the 
way these are handled vary, but sometimes proc-macros can be a problem.

Simply put, in Rust, the module tree is a hierarchical representation of your code's organization. Every Rust file can 
act as a module, with submodules nested within, creating a tree-like structure that evolves alongside your project.

Procedural macro crates do exist in this module tree. However, their source files often live in the root of the 
crate and not necessarily inside a `lib.rs` file. Furthermore, they aren't necessarily explicitly declared as modules.
These deviations from typical Rust code can cause difficulties for development tools that rely on a "conventional" 
project structure.

This isn't a universal issue, as it relies heavily on how each tool attempts to interpret procedural macros.

One practical workaround is to include the procedural macro code inside a `lib.rs` file within the procedural macro 
crate, particularly during dev time, so as to not cause problems on release (or other non-debug) builds. This decision 
might make the macros more 
accessible to certain development 
tools, potentially improving discovery, auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and documentation support.


**This is what this crate does.**

Alternatively, you could use the `#[path]` attribute along a module definition to point to the source file(s) in 
the cargo root, which in practice achieves pretty much the same. Some IDEs and environments also just simply work 
well with proc-macros, so a workaround 
isn't necessary in the first place.

While the solution provided by this crate is simple and effective, itâ€™s not one-size-fits-all. The best method 
depends on multiple factors like your tooling setup, personal preference, and the specific needs of your project.
Still, the existence of this crate provides a simple solution to the problem; to connect your procedural macro crate 
with the rest of your code, making it more discoverable by external tools.



## Extras
Additionally, include_proc_macro provides two convenient shorthand aliases, `here!` and `named!`:

```rust 
include_proc_macro::here!("sample"); 
```

Please note that using these aliases will yield the same result as directly using include_proc_macro. They are 
included for convenience and for prettier code (i.e for when you want to / have to use fully qualified paths).

>Note: 
> Seeing as (unused) macros do not introduce a compile-time or runtime overhead, and the namespace pollution 
> is both minimal and unlikely to clash or otherwise cause problems, having these 
> aliases seems okay to me.
However, if it turns out to be undesirable, we'll hide these behind a feature flag.
